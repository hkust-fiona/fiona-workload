üéâWelcome to the **FIONA Workload** repository!   
üéØThis sub-project is an integral part of the [FIONA-Toolchain](https://github.com/hkust-fiona/) and aims to provide a bundle of hand-tuned kernels and example neural-network applications that can run on [FIONA-SpikeSim](https://github.com/hkust-fiona/fiona-spikesim) and [FIONA-Hardware](https://github.com/hkust-fiona/fiona-hardware). The project hierarchy of this sub-project is shown as follows:

```
fiona-workload/
    |-- app/
        |-- hello_fiona/        ... hello-world sample for initial test
        |-- math_*/             ... example workloads of math library
        |-- nn_*/               ... example workloads of nn library
    |-- lib/
        |-- baremetal/          ... essential files for running without proxy kernels
        |-- base/               ... most basic headers including instruction defines
        |-- math/               ... provide libraries of photonic-backend math operations
        |-- nn/                 ... provide libraries of photonic-backend nn modules
        |-- utils/              ... provide utilities such as matrix printing
    |-- Makefile                ... script to auto compile all workloads
```


## Quickstarts
To compile the workloads, the RISC-V toolchain is required. Please follow the installation instructions by [RISC-V GNU Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) and [RISC-V Proxy Kernel](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk) before we continue the FIONA-Workload compilation.

```bash
# after you install RISC-V GNU Toolchain
export RISCV="<path/to/risc-v>"
git clone https://github.com/hkust-fiona/fiona-workload.git
cd fiona-workload/ && make
```

The compiled ELF files will be located in the directory of `build/`. To run on **spike** or **verilator**:

```bash
# please refer to the sibling project FIONA-SpikeSim
spike --extension=fiona pk build/<workload>.elf
```
